## Apollo-Websockets

This is a simple example showing how to utilise Websockets over GraphQL. This is just a proof of concept to show how subscriptions are made available.  You will have to use the GraphIQL for the time being. When i have the time I will be doing a sample client over Angular since most of the time you will find this implemented with React. Anyways, I tried to include as much variety as possible in terms of technologies.
